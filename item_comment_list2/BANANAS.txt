  I didn't know what I was thinking when ordering bananas which apparently were sent from Florida to Southern California.  You can imagine (but, perhaps, better not) the state of freshness they were in when they finally arrived! I'm only glad that they came close to garbage collection pick-up time so that I can get rid of them. You may ask yourself why I should order bananas when I could jolly well go to the market?! And, you'd be right except that I just had eye surgery and didn't want to look like the Bride of Frankenstein...so...that's my story.Sorry....amazon!

  Arrived looking like this
-----------------------------------------------
  Horrible. Every single banana was split open in the back, and there was a hissing sound, like there was carbonation or something. They weren't even ripe, totally green, yet they were mush, and had a horrible smell. Never buy these!
-----------------------------------------------
  They arrived rotten and all mushed together.  I will never buy again.

  Three out of 6 arrived rotten

  I always have a banana every day in my diet.  When I ran out and it got too snowy and cold to go out.  I substituted banana chips.  But when the real fresh bananas arrive and in good condition with a tiny bit of green on both ends, I was glad.  Couldn't wait to have one with breakfast.  Very tasty and well packed with taped ends and fast delivery.  I was so happy after eating I was close to happy tears. Good to know they can be ordered on Amazon.  I was leery but so glad I did and it was better then I imagined.  A little pricey but so well worth it.  Will buy again
-----------------------------------------------
  Bananas arrived mushy and black on the inside, hard and green on the outside and smelled terrible. Will not purchase again.

  Bought these bananas for my elderly parents that live an hour away after I forgot to include them when I drop of extra grocery for them weekly.  Yes bananas are .99/lb in the store. This was for pure convenience. Still took 3 days to delivery - so convenience took a small hit. Plus $15 for the same amount of bananas I pay $2.89 in the store is enough to make me get of my "too busy-right-now" ass and just spend $5 for gas and do it myself.
