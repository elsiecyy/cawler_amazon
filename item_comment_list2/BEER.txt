  This is the perfect gift for any beer-lover. Being relatively lightweight, even full of beer caps, it is a breeze to hang on any wall. Use a couple of nails and you're good to go.At first I wasnt sure how to put in the beer caps. You'll notice the spots are all open without any backing to hold the caps in place. There are three grooves in each opening that hold the caps. You kind of have to push hard to get them in place. Personally, I would lay the cap holder on top of a cap on a flat table and press down on either side of the holder with my hands about an inch apart. This was the best way for me to get them all level.Looks great on any wall.

  I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with how nicely made this product is by Skyline Workshop! It arrived in good time, it was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  I bought it for my son as a Christmas gift and I think he will love it.  It appears to be sturdy enough but I can't say yet how easily the caps go in.  I'm assuming they will fit just fine.  I bought the large maple USA Map and I love that it is made in the USA.  I would recommend this product for any beer drinker or cap collector - fun gift!

  Very nice product. The holes have 3 notches each, which line up with the fluted edge of the caps. It is a very tight fit for the cap. I don’t see them falling out. The burnt edges are a nice touch. The shape of the map is very detailed. We selected this particular product because it has 120 holes, and we are really thirsty! :D

  I purchased this as a gift for my brother-in-law and his soon to be bride, and they loved it.It's a nice, quality cut out.  No jagged edges, the wood is good quality.  It's thin but seems solid.

  This arrived very safely packaged and without any worries about damage. The map is very well made and the holes are perfect for the bottle caps. My brother in law loved it and is excited to put it up. It comes with perfect hanging holes already pre-drilled. Also, came with a free 'gift' of a few etched wooden coasters, which was an unexpected and appreciated surprise. It is a great product!Follow up! It has been a few month and my brother in law still loves it, it is perfect for his caps, he has almost filled it! One thing to mention, if your cap is bent or messed up it's not going to fit, it's not a flaw in the map, you have to be careful when you uncap your beer if you want it to be part of your map!

  This was a Christmas gift for my son. I love the concept and he’s a craft beer lover so he loved it too. It was packaged very well. I rated down in sturdiness because it was a lot thinner than I expected. It has to be handled very carefully to avoid breaking. We’ll see how it holds up as we place beer caps in the cut outs. Over-all, nice, unique gift and I’d buy it again.

  Bought for a Christmas gift for a beer lover. Product looks nice. Received an email from the company the day my item arrived with instructions on how to reach out in case I didn’t love it - after buying hundreds of things on Amazon, I really appreciated that the company who makes this clearly stands behind their product.

  Thought it was actually going to be a bit cheeessy...it was not. The wood is beautiful and placement of the holes are pretty good. It started family and friends to create adventures for the following year. They want to start traveling to collect caps to fill the gift....excellent conversation piece...adventure starter....thrill seeker kit! It is beautiful and classy. Thank you!
