  FAR too much money for 6 cans.  Look elsewhere!
-----------------------------------------------
  Flavor and thickness of soup were more than sufficient but the value of one can was NOT equal to $4.00, which is price I paid for six cans plus shipping.
-----------------------------------------------
  Didn’t open a single can.  All 6 cans were crushed, plan on throwing them out.  It’s too bad because I was really looking forward to enjoying that soup.  Can’t buy it in my area.

  So good to have
-----------------------------------------------
  Delicious but a little pricey from this vendor
-----------------------------------------------
  My order was a day early which was AMAZING!!!!
