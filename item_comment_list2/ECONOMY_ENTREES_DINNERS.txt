  I just paid $30 dollars for six of the tiniest TV dinners I have ever seen!  First of all, I mistakenly assumed, because of the price, that I was receiving six of each type of TV dinner. I was wrong!  But I didn’t know this until they were delivered. I kept looking in the box for the rest of them. And to add more insult to my discovery, the TV dinners taste bland. Six dinners for $30 dollars!  That’s five dollars each!  No way are they worth five dollars. The flavor isn’t worth one dollar!

  As a person disabled by brain injury with left-side hemi-paresis, I need something to heat easily and safely with only one working hand.  I do get Meals on Wheels, but--yawn.  This meaty variety pack is perfect for weekends and also to perk up my weekdays.  The selections are quite tasty.  I'd say I have eaten over 100 Compleats from Amazon, and they have all arrived in good condition and far away expiration date.  So go ahead--you deserve a Compleat break today!

  The taste of these items is good and much as I expected based on past experience with Hormel products.  Hormel provides product that are consistent and of high quality.  However, the small size of the portions meant that I ended up having two for lunch while at work.  So instead of 6 meals it was more like 3 meals which ran the cost up to over $7 per meal.  I would like it better if the product came in 500 to 600 calorie portions rather than 200 to 350 calorie portions.

  I take one of these to work for lunch or even for supper at night works out real good and the food is good. Will buy them again and will be great during this stay at home time.

  I got the Hormel Completes Meal variety pack so I would have something quick I could store in my desk at work for lunch. These meals are full of flavor and just enough to fill you up. Their thin and small size make it easy to store in your desk drawer, crowed pantry or cabinet or easily pack for camping or travel. Very simple to heat up and eat, it takes under a minute and you have a great meal.

  I liked the ability to just put it in my pantry for emergencies. The dates for use go for over a year! If the power went out, they don't need refrigeration and could be transfered to a pan for cooking by other means. I was surprised by the good flavors and consistency.

  The meal variety is pretty good.  The flavor and textures are ok but you can tell they are not home made.That being said, they are all good and easily prepared per the instructions.The nutritional info is clear so you know up front what you are getting.
-----------------------------------------------
  Hormel Completes Meals can be prepared by placing open container in microwave, cooking and it’s ready to eat. Great selection of easy to store or take along meal choices with very good taste.
