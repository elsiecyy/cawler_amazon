  I really hope this review helps someone. I've used Advocares Spark for a long time and was shocked when I received the product and the seal wasn't the normal very tight seal I'm use to peeling off. That was my first red flag, but then I thought, maybe they just use a different packaging company. Well after going through the canister (my husband and I shared this) we both were stunned that it's obviously not Spark. It might be Spark mixed with something else is what I'm thinking. We both had to do double doses to get the effect of regular Spark. During this time, I ordered from the Spark site and waited to finish this canister before opening the real Spark. It was sealed very tight (like usual) unlike this one and I immediately made myself a single serving and was immediately frustrated at knowing I had gotten ripped off. Please be cautious and only order from reputable sellers!

  Spark is where it's at.  This stuff is fantastic.  I doesn't give you the jitters like caffeine, but make you more alert and awake without making you feel weird.  This canister is pretty small though at 10.5 oz and it normally sells retail for about $50 which is pretty expensive for a small canister, but I am a huge fan.  If you can buy it for around $35, consider it a good deal though.  Just a little advice.

  Ohhhhhhh baby..... I got way back with Spark. It's the bomb. The price has sky rocketed over the years. The container is smaller than ever, the scoop is small but the taste is the same and the SPARK is the same! For price at just over a buck a scoop, it really pays off for a good multivitamin/caffeine boost drink. If you haven't tried it before, you want to get some. For real. Especially if you want a solid and healthier replacement to sugary energy drinks. You get the same boost that lasts longer and you feel better.

  Gives great energy without the jitters. My doc even approved of the ingredients when I took it to her to check its safety.

  I love this stuff. The flavor is awesome, itâ€™s easy to shake up and it gives me a ton of energy for hours. This works better than a coffee and a red bull! Highly recommend!

  This stuff works! I feel so great, good energy, no jitters! It really picked me up during the midday slump, no crash and it doesn't keep me from sleeping.
-----------------------------------------------
  Last for awhile and has a good taste. Make sure to shake thoroughly to make sure it mixes.

  I love this product! It's easy timid and taste delicious! It gives me the energy I need in the morning to get the house cleaned while chasing three kids and to exercise! It's not like a 5 hour energy that makes you jittery for 30 minutes and then you still have no energy.. This product also arrived as expected!
