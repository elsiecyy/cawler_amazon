  I work in a hot environment for 10 hours a day during the summertime, and I am probably not your typical baby food eater, but this is an excellent source of energy and it doesn't upset my stomach. This is an excellent choice over a candy bar or a granola bar in my situation. One of these every few hours with an electrolyte tablet does the trick and keeps me on the ball. Even though I am tired when I get off shift, I don't feel drained. Oh, and these taste great too.

  I normally make all my daughter’s baby food, she doesn’t like most store bought baby food; I would guess due to much of it being fruits and vegetables mixed together. She likes fruits and vegetables, but separately. I saw these pouches from amazon are just yogurt, apple, banana, and strawberry without any vegetables. I bought them thinking I could keep a couple in the diaper bag for emergencies but my husband and I can’t stop eating them, they’re so good! Our daughter likes them too, but we selfishly eat most of them and feel bad about it afterwards. I would give them 10 stars if I could. These are worth getting a prime membership for.Tip: the 3 of us agree these taste best cold, keep them in the refrigerator.

  I can only give you my input on one flavor: Pear, Apple, Broccoli. Let me state that my child does have an egg allergy. I know this doesn't say it contains any eggs, and I'm sure it doesn't but wanted to state that she does have an allergy. She had one pouch without any other dietary changes and her next diaper change, all of the skin had burn off her booty. I'm sure this is a wonderful product but if your child does have allergies just give them a little at first to make sure they do not have a mild reaction.

  I was excited to try this Amazon New Brand, so I bought a couple of flavors when they first release. At that time the first batch was good, so I decided to buy again. The second batch I noticed that the pouches did not have the fruity puree texture, instead they were pure liquid, like juice. It also tasted really bad, like rotten, my son complaint and I did not understand why, until I tried them, it was awful. I checked the expiration date and I still a month away of it. Even though I bought them on January 2019, they send me a batch with a 3 month expiration window, expiring on March 2019, it thought was very short. Anyways, do not take the risk, don't buy it.
-----------------------------------------------
  The first item we bought was excellent, the flavor the texture, my little one LOVED it! So, I purchased that flavor again and another flavor to try. There appears to not be any quality control because the flavor I had purchased again wasn't good. The texture was grainier and the flavor was horrible. It didn't even taste remotely the same (we taste EVERYTHING she eats). The other flavor we tried was plain pears and it didn't taste right either. Tasted fermented like cider does. We won't be purchasing again.

  Great value for the price! My son has a rare food allergy diagnosis called FPIES and so I have to be extremely careful to buy food with minimal and honest ingredients. I used to make all of my son’s purées, but now that he is older and I am working, I had to find food I could trust. Mama Bear Products are awesome, I cannot recommend them enough!!

  These Mango Apple Carrot Peach pouches from Mama Bear get two thumbs up from both my daughter and myself!My 8 month old daughter has been extremely picky with flavors since she started eating solid foods at 6 months old.  I've tried so many different flavors and combinations and she shakes her head "no" at almost all of them. The only thing she really liked was the plain flavorless rice or oatmeal cereal mixed with formula.  I decided to try these Mama Bear pouches on a whim.  They were affordable and could be added to my subscribe and save order with a coupon.I was completed surprised when she took right to them.  I mean like "feeding a little baby bird" behavior.  She kind of made a surprised face with the first bite and then opened wide, ready for the next one.  She has since expanded her palete to add some new flavors but this Mama Bear flavored pouch is still by far her favorite.  I love that she loves it, and I trust the Mama Bear brand because I've never had a bad experience with any of the Amazon branded products - they've all be excellent quality.If you've got a picky little eater, give the Mango Apple Carrot Peach flavor a try.

  These pouches don’t have a ton of foreign ingredients, let alone a ton of ingredients. Simple packaging and super tasty. My 8 year old is always forced by his ten month old sister to taste her food. She “shares” with him and he’s just so sweet he doesn’t want to discourage her. This food he was actually delighted to try. He even ate one for his after school snack instead of applesauce twice this week. The pouches are affordable and always my first choice as a go to snack for my kids. 5 out of 5 would recommend.
